GOKKAN(極寒)
=======================

Gokkan - just a japanese word for mid winter.

----------


WTF
-------------

Some dirty and messy code to interact from go-lang to CAN bus.

 - fw - Some CubeMX generated sources for Keil. Configured for stm32f103rb board (cheap shit, no CAN and USB simultaneously support) to proxy CANFrames to USART and backwards. FreeRTOS, STM32 and so other shit code has it own licenses and copyrights, Blah-blah-blah. Probably you could regenerate it for some free toolchain with CubeMX
 - protocol - implementation of my howegrown protocol callen PotatoBus (just because)
 - data - right now simply CANFrame marshaller\unmarshaller
 - driver - serila connectivity utils
